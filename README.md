# TimePlanningPro

A simple and intuitive browser-based calendar application is designed to manage daily work schedule with ease. Utilize the power of jQuery and Day.js to schedule your workday effectively and efficiently from 9 AM to 5 PM.

## Description

The TimePlanningPro is a dynamic application that allows users to add and save events for each hour of a typical workday. This application runs directly in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, leveraging the capabilities of jQuery for DOM manipulation and Day.js for date and time handling.

## Features

- **Current Day Display**: The application displays the current day at the top of the calendar.
- **Timeblock Layout**: Timeblocks are presented for standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM).
- **Color-Coded Timeblocks**: Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, allowing for easy identification of upcoming events.
- **Interactive Event Entries**: Users can click into a timeblock to enter an event's details.
- **Local Storage**: Events are saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even when the page is refreshed.



## Getting Started
- **Open the Application**: Launch your preferred web browser and open the Work Day Scheduler. No installation is required as the application runs directly in the browser.
- **View the Current Day**: At the top of the calendar, the current day is automatically displayed. This gives you a clear point of reference for planning your day.

## Using the Scheduler
- Navigate to the Current Hour: Scroll through the timeblocks, which are laid out in one-hour increments from 9 AM to 5 PM. The current hour is highlighted for your convenience.

- Add an Event:
Click on the timeblock that corresponds to the hour of your event.
A text area will open where you can type the details of your event.
- Save the Event:

After entering the details of your event, click the save button (represented by a disk icon) on the right side of the timeblock.
Your event is now saved to the browser's local storage, ensuring it remains accessible even after the browser is refreshed or reopened.
View Saved Events: Events that have been saved will be displayed within the appropriate timeblock. To view an event, simply navigate to the hour it was saved under.

- Edit an Event:

To change the details of an existing event, click on the timeblock where the event was saved.
Edit the text as needed and click the save button to update the event in local storage.

- **Tips**:
  
Regularly update your events to reflect any changes in your schedule.
Refresh the page at any time to ensure the latest saved events are loaded.
Use the color coding to quickly ascertain past, present, and future events at a glance.

- **Troubleshooting**:

If your events are not saving, ensure that your browser is not set to private or incognito mode, as this can affect the ability to save to local storage.
For any display issues, verify that you are using an up-to-date web browser.
